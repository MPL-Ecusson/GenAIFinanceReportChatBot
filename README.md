# GenAIFinanceReportChatBot
This repository shows output from a generative AI model (GPT-4o) with text embeddings tuned with Securities and Exchange Commission Reports (10-Q) for Apple Inc. 

🚀 Project Overview

As a data analyst in a fast-paced investment environment, reviewing quarterly 10-Q filings can be time-consuming and overwhelming. Each report contains hundreds of pages of financial statements, management discussions, risk disclosures, and operational details.

This project built an AI-powered financial analysis chatbot that interacts with real 10-Q filings from Apple Inc..

Using Azure OpenAI Services and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the chatbot transforms dense SEC filings into accessible, actionable insights through natural language conversations.

Instead of manually scanning reports, users can ask questions such as:

“What were Apple’s revenue trends this quarter?”

“What risks did management highlight?”

“How did operating margins change year-over-year?”

The chatbot retrieves relevant sections from the 10-Q filings and uses a large language model (e.g., GPT-4) to generate contextual, grounded answers.
